VSTSMonitor
===========

VSTSMonitor is a Windows application to query the Changeset & WorkItem in [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx). I personally find it helpful to monitor the progress of the development team and also to quickly find out changeset of a particular WorkItem.

The main purpose of this repository is to continue to develop VSTSMonitor, making it better and easier to use. If you're interested in helping with that, then keep reading. If you're not interested in helping right now that's ok too. :) Any feedback you have about using React would be greatly appreciated.




Development
----------------
This is a Windows WPF application written in C#. The solution file is compatible with Visual Studio 2015.

Things that you might want to get familiar with before you jump into the code:

 - [MVVM Light](http://www.mvvmlight.net/)
 - [.NET client libraries for Visual Studio Team Services ](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/get-started/client-libraries/samples)

Lastly, I'm ok with anyway you want to revolutionize it. As long as you follow the best practices.
